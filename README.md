# Unit-Testing
In a group of two, we build a game called CoffeeMakerQuest using Test Driven Development to cover unit testing.
CoffeeMakerQuest is an old school text-based adventure game where the player
searches a house for coffee, cream, and sugar to make a cup of coffee for
herself.

* CoffeeMakerQuestUnitTest.java - The JUnit class that unit tests CoffeeMakerQuest objects.
* PlayerUnitTest.java - The JUnit class that unit tests Player objects.
* RoomUnitTest.java - The JUnit class that unit tests Room objects.
* GameIntegrationTest.java - The JUnit class that integration tests the entire CoffeeMakerQuest game.

## How to Use
1. Have all files open in VS code
2. Run the program choosing "Launch Game"
